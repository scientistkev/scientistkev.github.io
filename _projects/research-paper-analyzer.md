## Project Overview

The Research Paper Analyzer is an AI-powered tool designed to help researchers, students, and academics quickly understand and analyze scientific literature. It combines natural language processing techniques with domain-specific knowledge to extract meaningful insights from research papers.

## Motivation

The exponential growth in scientific literature makes it increasingly difficult for researchers to stay current with developments in their field. This tool addresses the challenge by:

- Automatically summarizing key findings
- Extracting methodological approaches
- Identifying research gaps and opportunities
- Tracking citation networks and influence
- Comparing related work across papers

## Technical Architecture

### Natural Language Processing Pipeline

The system employs a multi-stage NLP pipeline:

1. **Document Processing**: PDF parsing and text extraction
2. **Section Identification**: Automatic detection of paper sections
3. **Entity Recognition**: Extraction of technical terms, methods, and datasets
4. **Relationship Extraction**: Identification of relationships between concepts
5. **Summarization**: Generation of concise summaries for each section

### Machine Learning Components

```python
class PaperAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.summarizer = pipeline("summarization", 
                                 model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")
        self.ner_model = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")
        self.classifier = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(
            "allenai/scibert-scivocab-uncased"
        )
    
    def analyze_paper(self, paper_text):
        sections = self.extract_sections(paper_text)
        entities = self.extract_entities(paper_text)
        summary = self.generate_summary(paper_text)
        classification = self.classify_research_area(paper_text)
        
        return {
            'sections': sections,
            'entities': entities,
            'summary': summary,
            'classification': classification
        }
```
