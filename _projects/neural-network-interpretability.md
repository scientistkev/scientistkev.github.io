## Overview

The Neural Network Interpretability Toolkit provides researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive set of tools for understanding how deep neural networks make decisions. This project addresses the critical need for transparency in AI systems, especially in high-stakes applications.

## Key Features

### Gradient-Based Methods

- **Gradient Visualization**: Visualize gradients with respect to input features
- **Integrated Gradients**: Compute attribution scores using integrated gradients
- **Guided Backpropagation**: Enhanced gradient visualization technique

### Activation Analysis

- **Layer-wise Activation Maps**: Understand what different layers learn
- **Feature Map Visualization**: Visualize convolutional feature maps
- **Activation Maximization**: Find inputs that maximize specific neurons

### Model Probing

- **Linear Probing**: Test what information is encoded in representations
- **Concept Activation Vectors**: Measure sensitivity to human-interpretable concepts
- **Representation Similarity Analysis**: Compare learned representations

## Technical Implementation

The toolkit is built with modularity and extensibility in mind:

```python
from nn_interpretability import InterpretabilityAnalyzer

# Initialize analyzer with your model
analyzer = InterpretabilityAnalyzer(model)

# Generate various interpretability visualizations
gradients = analyzer.compute_gradients(input_data)
activations = analyzer.get_layer_activations(input_data, layer_name)
attributions = analyzer.integrated_gradients(input_data, target_class)
```
