## Project Overview

The Automated Data Pipeline Framework is designed to simplify the creation and management of complex data processing workflows. It provides a declarative approach to defining data pipelines with automatic dependency resolution, error handling, and monitoring capabilities.

## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Pipeline Orchestrator**: Manages workflow execution and dependencies
- **Data Processors**: Modular components for data transformation
- **Quality Monitors**: Automated data quality checks and alerts
- **Storage Adapters**: Flexible interfaces for various data sources
- **Monitoring Dashboard**: Real-time pipeline status and metrics

### Design Principles

- **Modularity**: Reusable components for common data operations
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling for large data volumes
- **Reliability**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Observability**: Detailed logging and monitoring
- **Flexibility**: Support for various data sources and formats

## Key Features

### Declarative Configuration

Define pipelines using simple YAML configuration:

```yaml
pipeline:
  name: "user_analytics_pipeline"
  schedule: "0 2 * * *"  # Daily at 2 AM
  
  tasks:
    - name: "extract_user_data"
      type: "sql_extract"
      source: "production_db"
      query: "SELECT * FROM users WHERE updated_at >= {{ yesterday }}"
      
    - name: "transform_user_data"
      type: "python_transform"
      depends_on: ["extract_user_data"]
      script: "transforms/user_analytics.py"
      
    - name: "load_to_warehouse"
      type: "sql_load"
      depends_on: ["transform_user_data"]
      target: "analytics_warehouse"
      table: "user_analytics"
```

### Automatic Data Quality Checks

Built-in quality assurance with customizable rules:

- Schema validation
- Data freshness checks
- Statistical anomaly detection
- Custom business rule validation
- Automated alerting on quality issues

### Error Handling and Recovery

Robust error management features:

- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Dead letter queues for failed records
- Partial failure handling
- Manual intervention workflows
- Comprehensive error logging
